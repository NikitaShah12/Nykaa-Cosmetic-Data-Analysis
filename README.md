The project is segmented into three core analytical modules:

### üìà Stock Data Analysis

This module focuses on the financial performance of Nykaa's stock (NYKAA.NS) from its market debut on November 10, 2021, to November 24, 2023.

**Process:**
1.  **Data Retrieval:** Historical stock data was fetched using the `yfinance` library.
2.  **Trend Analysis:** Opening Price, Closing Price, and Trading Volume were visualized using Plotly to identify long-term trends.
3.  **Technical Indicators:** 50-day and 200-day moving averages were calculated and plotted to smooth out price data and identify significant market trends.
4.  **Interactive Visualization:** A user-interactive Candlestick chart was created to explore daily price action (Open, High, Low, Close).
5.  **Dashboard Creation:** The cleaned data was exported to create a comprehensive and stylish dashboard in Microsoft Excel.

**Key Visuals:**

2.  **Sentiment Scoring:** The `TextBlob` library was used to perform sentiment polarity analysis on each review, categorizing it as 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral'.
3.  **Visualization:**
    * A count plot was generated to show the distribution of sentiment categories.
    * A `WordCloud` was created to highlight the most frequently used words in the reviews, offering a quick glance at the main topics of discussion.

**Key Visuals:**

* **Sentiment Distribution:**

**Process:**
1.  **Data Wrangling:** Datasets for 2022 and 2023 were loaded, cleaned, and pre-processed. This included handling missing values and converting data types.
2.  **Product Categorization:** A custom function was built to categorize products (e.g., 'Serum', 'Mask', 'Moisturizer') based on keywords in their titles.
3.  **Analysis of Key Metrics:**
    * **Pricing:** Identified the most and least expensive products.
    * **Reviews:** Found products with the highest and lowest number of reviews.

* **Stock Performance:** Nykaa's stock has shown a consistent **downward trend** since its IPO, with the price frequently trading below its 50-day and 200-day moving averages, signaling market weakness. However, a slight recovery was noted in the final month of the analysis period.

    * **Dominant Brands:** **Nykaa Cosmetics** and **Nykaa Naturals** have the largest presence, showcasing the success of Nykaa's in-house brands.
    * **Pricing & Promotions:** The most common discount offered is **10% off**. High-value items, like Huda Beauty palettes, represent the upper end of the price spectrum, while affordable daily-use items like Biotique soaps form the lower end.

## üöÄ Future Scope

This project serves as a solid foundation for more advanced analysis. Future enhancements could include:

* **Predictive Stock Analysis:** Implementing time-series forecasting models (like ARIMA or LSTM) to predict future stock prices.
* **Advanced NLP:** Using topic modeling (e.g., LDA) on customer reviews to discover more granular insights about what customers like or dislike (e.g., "delivery," "packaging," "ingredient quality").
* **Recommendation Engine:** Building and deploying a collaborative or content-based filtering recommendation system to provide personalized product suggestions to users.
* **Competitor Analysis:** Scraping and analyzing data from competitor websites to benchmark Nykaa's performance in terms of pricing, product assortment, and promotions.
* **Automated BI Reporting:** Creating a fully automated Power BI dashboard that updates in real-time as new data becomes available.
